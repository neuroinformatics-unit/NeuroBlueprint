# SWC-Blueprint

`SWC-Blueprint` is a project folder structure specification for use in the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/).
It is inspired by, and based on the [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) widely used in human neuroimaging.

This repository hosts the source code for the [SWC-Blueprint website](https://swc-blueprint.neuroinformatics.dev).
