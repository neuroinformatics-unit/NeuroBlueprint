# SWC BIDS - The SWC Folder Organisation Specification based on BIDS

A standardised folder structure used by researchers across neuroscience projects makes data organisation, analysis and collaboration easier. 
This page will outline the folder structure and file naming standards recommended at the SWC, based on the BIDS format. The BIDS format is a project structure specification widely used in human research with ongoing initiatives to extend this to animal research. It is developed and maintained by the [BIDS community](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).

The BIDS specification is very developed and in its entirety rather detailed and long. Here in the first instance, we aim to provide a brief subset of this specification aimed at introducing a standardised project folder structure across the SWC with minimal overhead for researchers. Future tools created by the neuroinformatics-unit for convenient, standardized data analysis pipelines will be built to interpolate seamlessly with this folder structure.
