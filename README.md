# SWC BIDS - The SWC Folder Organisation Specification based on BIDS

SWC-BIDS is a project folder structure specification for use in the SWC, based on the [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) widely used in human neuroimaging. 

The aim of this specification is to provide a set of rules and guidelines for project folder organisation ensuring consistent data management within and between labs. 

SWC-BIDS aims to provide a subset of the wide-ranging BIDS specification for everyday use in the SWC with minimal overhead for researchers. We will also collaborate with [ongoing efforts](https://github.com/INCF/neuroscience-data-structure) to extend the BIDS specification to research with non-human animals by the [BIDS community](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).

At the Neuroinformatics Unit, all tools we produce will interoperate seamlessly with projects organised according to the SWC-BIDS specification.
