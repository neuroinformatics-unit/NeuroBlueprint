NeuroBlueprint is developed by the
[NeuroInformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev)
at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre.

We are keen for feedback on the standard and encourage feedback through 
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/NeuroBlueprint)
or on our
[Zulip Chat](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/406000-NeuroBlueprint).

We are keen to work closely with ongoing standardisation efforts in the
[BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io)
and
[NWB](https://www.nwb.org) 
communities.

Please see our 
[Guiding Principles](https://datashuttle.neuroinformatics.dev/pages/community/guiding-principles.html) 
and 
[Roadmap](roadmap.md) 
for more details on our future plans.
