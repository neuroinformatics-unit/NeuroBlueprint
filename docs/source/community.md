# Community

NeuroBlueprint is developed by the
[NeuroInformatics Unit]()
at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre.

We are keen for feedback on the standard and
encourage feedback through [GitHub Issues]()
or on our
[Zulip Chat]().

We are keen to work closely with ongoing
standardisation efforts in the
[BIDS]()
and
[NWB]() communities.

Please see our [Guiding Principles]()  (LINK TO DS?)
and [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for more details on our future plans.
