NeuroBlueprint is developed by the
[NeuroInformatics Unit](https://neuroinformatics.dev)
at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre. We are very interested in feedback on the
specification, please get in contact through our
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/NeuroBlueprint)
or
[Zulip Chat](https://neuroinformatics.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/406000-NeuroBlueprint)!

We are keen to work closely with ongoing standardisation efforts in the
[BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io)
and
[NWB](https://www.nwb.org)
communities. Please see our
[Guiding Principles](https://datashuttle.neuroinformatics.dev/pages/community/guiding-principles.html)
and
[Roadmap](roadmap.md)
for more details on our future plans.
