# Roadmap

The roadmap for NeuroBlueprint
contains our development plans for the package.
It is closely aligned with
[datashuttle roadmap]()
and our
[guiding principles]().

The roadmap is responsive to the requirements
of the community and we encourage people to get in
contact to outline their needs and priorities.

The aim of NeuroBlueprint v2.0 was to
provide a lightweight specification
enabling automatic discovery of raw data and
derivatives for different data types (e.g., behavior, electrophysiology).

Next, we plan to extend the specification to support automated
multimodal analysis. This will require metadata standardisation,
and we will decide on an existing metadata standard to adopt and minimal
set of required keywords.

**Q3 2024**

- Investigate and adopt a metadata standard (e.g. BIDS or Allen AIND)

**Q4 2024**

- Add required metadata for automated multimodal behavioural and electrophysiolgical analysis to the specification.
