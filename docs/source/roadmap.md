# Roadmap

The roadmap for **NeuroBlueprint**
contains our development plans for the specification.

The roadmap is responsive to the requirements
of the community, and we encourage people to get in
contact to outline their needs and priorities.

The aim of **NeuroBlueprint**
[v0.2](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/NeuroBlueprint/releases)
was to provide a lightweight specification
enabling automatic discovery of raw data for
different data types (e.g., behavior, electrophysiology).

Next, we plan to extend the specification to support automated
multimodal analysis. This will require metadata standardisation,
and we will decide on an existing metadata standard to adopt and a minimal
set of required keywords.

**Q4 2024**

- Investigate and adopt a metadata standard (e.g.
[Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/derivatives/common-data-types.html)
or
[Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-data-schema)).

- Add required metadata for automated multimodal behavioural and electrophysiological
analysis to the specification.
