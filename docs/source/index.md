# SWC-Blueprint

`SWC-Blueprint` is a project folder structure specification for use in the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/).
It is inspired by, and based on the [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) widely used in human neuroimaging.

The [SWC-Blueprint specification](specification.md) provides a set of rules and guidelines for project folder organisation, ensuring consistent data management within and between labs. It is intended for everyday use in the SWC with minimal overhead for researchers.

`SWC-Blueprint` is being developed by the SWC's [Neuroinformatics Unit (NIU)](https://neuroinformatics.dev/). Any data analysis tools developed by the NIU will prioritise interoperability with projects organised according to the SWC-Blueprint specification.

The NIU will also collaborate with [ongoing efforts](https://github.com/INCF/neuroscience-data-structure) by the [INCF](https://www.incf.org/) and [BIDS community](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) to extend the BIDS specification to research with non-human animals.
