**SWC-Blueprint** is a folder structure specification for (systems) neuroscience research projects. It is inspired by, and based on the [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), widely used in human neuroimaging.

The [SWC-Blueprint specification](specification.md) provides a set of rules and guidelines for project folder organisation, ensuring consistent data management within and between labs. The focus is on ensuring minimal overhead for researchers.

**SWC-Blueprint** is being developed at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/) by members of the [Neuroinformatics Unit (NIU)](https://neuroinformatics.dev/). As such, it prioritizes interoperability with NIU-developed data analysis tools.

That said, the specification is designed to be as general as possible, and should be useful to anyone within the neuroscience field. We (the NIU) welcome [feedback](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/SWC-Blueprint/discussions) and contributions from the wider community and commit to maintaining the specification as a living and evolving document. We will also collaborate with [ongoing efforts](https://github.com/INCF/neuroscience-data-structure) by the [INCF](https://www.incf.org/) and [BIDS community](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) to extend the BIDS specification to non-human animal research.
