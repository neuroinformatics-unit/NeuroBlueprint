**NeuroBlueprint** is a folder structure specification for (systems) neuroscience research projects. It is inspired by, and based on the [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), widely used in human neuroimaging.

The [NeuroBlueprint specification](specification.md) provides a set of rules and guidelines for project folder organisation, ensuring consistent data management within and between labs. The focus is on ensuring minimal overhead for researchers. If you are interested in further standardisation, making your data even more XXX, then check out our page on XXX FAIR PRINCIPLES.

**NeuroBlueprint** is being developed at the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/) by members of the [Neuroinformatics Unit (NIU)](https://neuroinformatics.dev/). As such, it prioritizes interoperability with NIU-developed data analysis tools.

That said, the specification is designed to be as general as possible, and should be useful to anyone within the neuroscience field. We (the NIU) welcome [feedback](https://github.com/neuroinformatics-unit/NeuroBlueprint/discussions) and contributions from the wider community and commit to maintaining the specification as a living and evolving document. We will also collaborate with [ongoing efforts](https://github.com/INCF/neuroscience-data-structure) by the [INCF](https://www.incf.org/) and [BIDS community](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) to extend the BIDS specification to non-human animal research.
