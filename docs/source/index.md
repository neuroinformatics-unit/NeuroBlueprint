# SWC-Blueprint

![](_static/swc-blueprint_logo_web.png)


`SWC-Blueprint` is a project folder structure specification designed for the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (SWC) for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/).
It is inspired by, and based on the [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), widely used in human neuroimaging.

The [SWC-Blueprint specification](specification.md) provides a set of rules and guidelines for project folder organisation, ensuring consistent data management within and between labs.

Developed by SWC's [Neuroinformatics Unit (NIU)](https://neuroinformatics.dev/), `SWC-Blueprint` ensures minimal overhead for researchers and prioritizes interoperability with NIU-developed data analysis tools. 

The NIU will also collaborate with [ongoing efforts](https://github.com/INCF/neuroscience-data-structure) by the [INCF](https://www.incf.org/) and [BIDS community](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) to extend the BIDS specification to non-human animal research.
